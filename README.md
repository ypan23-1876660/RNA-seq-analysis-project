**Background** <br>
SSRIDDS and CdLS are syndromic neurodevelopmental Mendelian disorders of chromatin modification with overlapping clinical phenotypes. While SSRIDD and CdLS patients show a spectrum of clinical phenotype, the severity of these phenotypes can greatly differ among different variations within the same gene. The shared biological mechanisms behind these diseases are very little known. 

**Goal** <br>
Perform differential gene expression analysis to examine the gene expression in CdLS-associated samples and compare the most significant genes to the control samples are expressed in SSRIDD-associated samples.
